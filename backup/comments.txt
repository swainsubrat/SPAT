1. Similarity (Should be better than the original method)
2. Robust Accuracy (It is higher than original method)
3. Response against existing defences
4. Show the drawabacks of original methods against the on-manifold.
5. Show statisticial measurement of the original adversarial noise vs on-manifold adversarial noise.
6. Targeted on-manifold attack [*]
7. Class-invariance solution for real-world images [*]

1. LPIPS vs Robust Accuracy
2. Robust accuracy of their scheme(david stutz)
3. Class invariance is better captured in my scheme
